About:
This project is a basic implementation of the following assignment to prove
that I can program in rails.

Usage:
bundle install
Edit the databases.yml file as needed and create db users on your host as needed
rake db:setup
rails server
http://localhost:3000/
Sign in with a user from the seeds.rb file, perhaps (programmer@test.com, opensaysme) or create your own.

Assignment:
Create a job board for users to post their own jobs and responding to others.  It should contain the following functionality:
- Viewing the jobs does not require logging in, but posting or responding does.
- A user needs to register to be able to sign in.
- A user has a name and an email address, and a password.
- A logged-in user can create a job posting and /edit/delete these.
- A job posting has a title, a company, a description.
- A logged-in user can respond to a job which provides a message to the job creator in a simple inbox format.
- Unit tests.

Do not worry about:
- Making it pretty.
- Using fancy JavaScript.
- Writing all functionality yourself (gems are your friend!)
